Create REST API of tmanagement service

1) Create task {order_name: "make product", start_date: "01-01-2022"}, edit, delete
2) Add work {task: "task 1", duration: 2, resource: 10} to the task, delete the work
3) Add an array of previous jobs to the job {pred: [1, 2, 3]}

Write a computational service that calculates the duration of the project (assuming that there is a limit of resource use max = 10) by creating randomly 1000000 sequences of activities and calculates in parallel the durations of each sequence (a prototype of a genetic algorithm)
